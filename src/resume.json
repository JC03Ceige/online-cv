      "summary": "Before I came across the Full-Stack Development starship, I traveled the universe across galaxies as wild as Film-Making, Business Law and Banking. There was always something not quite right with finding a balance between my extremely vast field of interests, my love for problem solving and applying systematic logic - while at the same time having an creative outlet. Needless to say, I never thought that my childhood hobbie of hacking games like Theme Hospital in DOS would turn out to embody a great deal of what I love doing. Now, with Full-Stack Web Development, I finally have the perfect vehicle to go wherever I want in this fantastical universe we live in",
